# Deep_learning

This is a repository for 02456 deep learing course at DTU. I am a student in my master on my 9th semester.

## Lecture 1 - Neural Networks
In this lecture we learn basic neural network (\textbf{nn}) this i a network containing only one hidden layer (K) and arbitrarely many hidden units (D). We also get introduce to deep nn, nn containing more than one hidden layer (K), to gradient descent and loss function, but dont go into details. See (call 1.1 FNN Pen and paper) for exercises.

## Lecture 2 - Learning
In this lecture we learn about NN learning through loss functions and gradient descent. How derive loss function and gradient descent for specific use cases, such as classification.
